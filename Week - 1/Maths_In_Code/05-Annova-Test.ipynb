    "# The Complete Guide to ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is ANOVA?\n",
    "ANOVA is a statistical hypothesis test used to check if the **means** of three or more independent groups are significantly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why not just use T-tests?**\n",
    "    If you have 3 groups (A, B, C) and run three separate T-tests (A vs B, B vs C, A vs C), your error rate compounds. A single T-test has a 5% chance of a false positive ($\\alpha = 0.05$). Three T-tests increase this risk to $\\approx 14\\%$.\n",
    "    * **ANOVA Solution:** It tests all variances simultaneously to maintain a 5% error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Use Cases in Data Science:**\n",
    "    * **Feature Selection:** Determining if a categorical feature (e.g., *Region*) statistically impacts a numerical target (e.g., *House Price*).\n",
    "    * **A/B/C Testing:** Comparing multiple versions of a webpage or algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** All group means are equal.\n",
    "    $$\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu_3 = ... = \\mu_k$$\n",
    "    *(Translation: The groups are essentially the same; any difference is due to luck.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** At least one group mean is different.\n",
    "    *(Translation: The category/grouping actually matters.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The Logic (F-Statistic)\n",
    "ANOVA compares two types of variation using the **F-Ratio**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F = \\frac{\\text{Variance BETWEEN Groups}}{\\text{Variance WITHIN Groups}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variance Between Groups:** How different the group means are from the global mean (Signal).\n",
    "* **Variance Within Groups:** How spread out the data is inside each group (Noise).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "* **High F-value:** Signal > Noise. The groups are distinct. (Reject $H_0$).\n",
    "* **Low F-value:** Noise > Signal. The groups overlap. (Fail to reject $H_0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Assumptions (Crucial for Interviews)\n",
    "If your data fails these, your ANOVA results are invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Normality:** Residuals should be normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk Test).\n",
    "2.  **Homogeneity of Variance:** Variances in each group must be roughly equal (Levene’s Test).\n",
    "3.  **Independence:** Samples must be independent (Random sampling).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: If data is NOT normal, use the **Kruskal-Wallis H Test** (Non-parametric ANOVA).*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 5. Implementation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. One-Way ANOVA (Scipy)\n",
    "Comparing one categorical factor against a numerical target.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import scipy.stats as stats\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Website Time Spent (seconds) for 3 different Designs\n",
    "design_A = [25, 30, 28, 35, 29]\n",
    "design_B = [45, 55, 60, 50, 58]\n",
    "design_C = [30, 32, 31, 33, 29]\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Run the test\n",
    "f_stat, p_value = stats.f_oneway(design_A, design_B, design_C)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"F-Stat: {f_stat:.2f} | P-Value: {p_value:.5f}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Interpret\n",
    "alpha = 0.05\n",
    "if p_value < alpha:\n",
    "    print(\"REJECT Null Hypothesis: At least one design is significantly different.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"FAIL TO REJECT: No significant difference found.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Post-Hoc Analysis (Tukey's HSD)\n",
    "ANOVA tells you *that* there is a difference, but not *where*. Use Tukey's HSD to find the specific pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd\n",

    "df = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "    'score': design_A + design_B + design_C,\n",
    "    'group': ['A']*5 + ['B']*5 + ['C']*5\n",
    "})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run Tukey\n",
    "tukey = pairwise_tukeyhsd(endog=df['score'], groups=df['group'], alpha=0.05)\n",

    "     B      C     -22.4   0.001      True  <-- Significant Diff\n",

    "## 6. Feature Selection (Scikit-Learn)\n",
    "In ML pipelines, use ANOVA (`f_classif`) to select the best features.\n",
